### lit.js

A literary workshop app based on node.js, express.js, backbone.js, mongodb (mongoose), and some other good stuff, an architecture culled from Mark Bates' book [Programming in Coffeescript](https://github.com/markbates/Programming-In-CoffeeScript).
(if you are looking for the older backend only version, checkout branch v0.4.9 (also tagged as v0.4.9 on master branch).

See below for installation instructions.

## Description and general instructions

For now this is a pedagogical effort aimed at acquiring solvency for using a node.js, express.js and couchdb stack.

When it is completed, there will be an active demo site using it. I actually would like to write a flash fiction piece every day using this.

All code and docs, all process for the project, can now be found at [Pivotal Tracker public project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/648835).
