### lit.js

A literary workshop app based on node.js

#### "Under construction" of course: that's what makes it interesting.
When it is completed, there will be an active demo site using it. I actually would like to write a flash fiction piece every day using this.

All code and docs, all process for the project, are right here on github; go to [Wiki](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki) for [User Stories](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki/User-stories) and [Architectural Document]((https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki/Architecture-document), see [Issue Tracking](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/issues) for project overview and User Manual (when ready).

##### Current status 

To fully implement this User story, we need to completely refactor the text model along the clean lines of the user model, and persist texts by author in Couchdb:

[Wiki view: As a writer I can work on my texts](/victorkane/lit/wiki/As-a-writer-i-can-work-on-my-texts)

[Implementation issue view: As a writer I can work on my texts](/victorkane/lit/issues/7)

Then we can go back and finish #6 with full navigation as per [Getting started](/victorkane/lit/wiki/Getting-started).

User profile has already been persisted in CouchDB:

[Wiki view: As a writer I can register as a user and work on my account and profile](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki/As-a-writer-I-can-register-as-a-user-and-work-on-my-account-and-profile)

[Implementation issue view: As a writer I can register as a user and work on my account and profile](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/issues/6)
