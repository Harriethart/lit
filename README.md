### lit.js

A literary workshop app based on node.js

#### "Under construction" of course: that's what makes it interesting.
When it is completed, there will be an active demo site using it. I actually would like to write a flash fiction piece every day using this.

All code and docs, all process for the project, are right here on github; go to [Wiki](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki) for [User Stories](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki/User-stories) and [Architectural Document]((https://github.com/victorkane/lit/wiki/Architecture-document), see [Issue Tracking](https://github.com/victorkane/lit/issues) for project overview and User Manual (when ready).
